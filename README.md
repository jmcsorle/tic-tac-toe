## Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals for this project asre to endure that I am able to demonstrate an understand and independently demonstrate the following
 - DRY JavaScript: my code is not repetitive, which makes it easier to read and test
 - The ability to implement event listeners and use event handlers to delegate actions from targets to the most logical parent element (e.g. utilize event delegation to handle similar event listeners)
 - Demonstrate an understanding of the differences between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
 - Use for loops to iterate through DOM elements
 - Use a problem solving process to break down large problems:
   - solve things step-by-step
   - use console.log to troubleshoot
   - use research resources through Mozilla Developer Network, W3Schools, and other resources utilized during Mod1

### CSS Grid and Responsive Design
To set up the basic structure for the page, I reviewed a YouTub video titled, [Responsive CSS Grid Tutorial by Angela Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA) and followed her instructions to set up the main grid and make the design responsive.

I then reviewed another resource titled, [Create a Nested Grid](https://www.quackit.com/css/grid/tutorial/create_a_nested_grid.cfm#:~:text=Grid%20items%20can%20become%20grids,and%20it%20becomes%20a%20grid.) about nesting grids within grids so that I could create the Tic Tac Toe grid inside of the .game-board grid area. I wanted to put a separate grid in this area so that when it reflowed, the game-board would remain intact.
