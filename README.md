## Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals for this project asre to endure that I am able to demonstrate an understand and independently demonstrate the following
 - DRY JavaScript: my code is not repetitive, which makes it easier to read and test
 - The ability to implement event listeners and use event handlers to delegate actions from targets to the most logical parent element (e.g. utilize event delegation to handle similar event listeners)
 - Demonstrate an understanding of the differences between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
 - Use for loops to iterate through DOM elements
 - Use a problem solving process to break down large problems:
   - solve things step-by-step
   - use console.log to troubleshoot
   - use research resources through Mozilla Developer Network, W3Schools, and other resources utilized during Mod1
