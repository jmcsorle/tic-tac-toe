2. Complete functions for data model: creating players, tracking data on the game board, turn-taking (maybe use toggle?), winCondition function, function that determines a draw, function that resets for a new game (will need to research the timeout and how to have the board reset automatically - would prefer to have a new game button so that users can decide when to reset for accessibility purposes)
